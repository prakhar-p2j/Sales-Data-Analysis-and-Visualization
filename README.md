A company that manufactures computer peripherals is experiencing decrease in their revenue. The Sales Manager wants to understand the reason behind the falling sales.
He wants the answer to following question:

1. What is revenue breakdown by cities?
2. What is monthyl and yearly revenue overall and of particular product?
3. Who are the top 5 customers of the company by revenue?
4. Which products are performing best and grossing highest revenue?

To Answer these questions, I first imported the sales dataset to MySQL database to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
Then connected the MySQL database to Tableau to create interactive dashboards that answers the questions of the sales manager.
